# pcb_contact_card
I have created a contact card from a pcb for fun.
Contact card files have been uploaded to enter the pcb design challange of jlcpcb.com . The pcb has dimensions of a credit card ,and it has a bottle opener shape on one of its edges. I have added my contact information on it and i gave some information about my current educational stasus and my interests. It is opensourced so anyone can download and edit files to create personal contact pcb. But, please do not use or manufacture my card.
